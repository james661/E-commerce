# E-commerce
Repo for Challenge 13
This challenge was to create the backend for the E-commerce site. It allows the user to view products, tags, and categories of products while also able to delete, add, or update all of the above.
Starter Code was provided by the UCSD bootcamp staff. I do not own any starter code.
Much of this assignment was completed with the help of my instructor, TA's, and the tutorial the instructor performed while creating https://github.com/QFults/thedogblog.
